It takes a village to make these resources 

- Core MASH and MAST team

```         
-   Design of questions

-   Develop resources (e.g., quizzes)

-   In-house Numbas training and support for staff
```

-   Collaborators

    -   Provide context (e.g., relevant applications, disciplinary priorities, notation)

    -   Review content

    -   Co-design questions

-   Casual workers

    -   Draft questions

    -   Experiment with new formats and designs

## In conclusion

::: incremental
-   Exploring the potentials of Numbas changed the way both students and staff engage with Mathematics and Statistics support support at the University of Bath.

-   We are working together and help one another.

-   We are developing a systematic review process for co-designed questions to ensure quality.


-   **What's next?**

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Keep challenging the limits of Numbas and expand the MASH question bank.
    -   Explore and evaluate the use of Numbas in teaching non-mathematics specialists.
